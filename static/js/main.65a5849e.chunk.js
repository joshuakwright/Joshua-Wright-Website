After this I began working on my own doing small fixes, such as sql updates, basic input validation, and just general bug fixes. As I progressed, I started working on more complicated projects, such as creating new database tables and data access functionality, adding a comment section to one page, a new table or column to another, and improving performance on poorly designed pages. All of the skills I built doing this came together to help me with my final pinnacle project at Pilot. I fully designed two new web pages for their invoice tracking site. This involved creating the database tables, data access layer, mid-end controllers, services, the two pages, extensive input validation and user functionality to insert, add, update, and delete sets and the suppliers they contained.

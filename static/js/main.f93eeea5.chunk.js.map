Welcome to my website. Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm currently enrolled at the \r\n          University of Tennessee Knoxville as a senior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. However, \r\n          this summer, I am interning at Cisco Systems as a Technical Undergraduate intern working on developing \r\n          testing software for Cisco's Spitfire class routers.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Like most people, I have a background too. I'm originally from Nashville, Tennessee, where I attended \r\n          Christ Presbyterian Academy. This is where I became an Eagle Scout and played a multitude of sports, \r\n          including: swimming, cross-country, track, and mountain biking. Now I spend most of my free time lifting \r\n          weights, swimming, and going on a hike whenever I get the chance.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          When looking to the future I have several interests. I'm fascinated by the development of machine learning \r\n          and AI in today's world and would love nothing more than to be a part of that after my time in college comes \r\n          to an end. However, as I am also a math major, I enjoy various types of algorithm design and the theory that \r\n          comes with it.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          If you'd like to know more, check out the other pages of my website for a much more in depth description of my \r\n          experiences. Don't forget to visit my resume page as well and download a copy to take with you.

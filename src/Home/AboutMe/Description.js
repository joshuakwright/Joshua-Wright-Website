          Hi there! Welcome to my website. Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm currently enrolled at the 
          University of Tennessee Knoxville as a senior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. However, 
          this summer, I am interning at Cisco Systems as a Technical Undergraduate intern working on developing 
          testing software for Cisco's Spitfire class routers.

          Like most people, I have a background too. I'm originally from Nashville, Tennessee, where I attended 
          Christ Presbyterian Academy. This is where I became an Eagle Scout and played a multitude of sports, 
          including: swimming, cross-country, track, and mountain biking. Now I spend most of my free time lifting 
          weights, swimming, and going on a hike whenever I get the chance.
        </p>

          When looking to the future I have several interests. I'm fascinated by the development of machine learning 
          and AI in today's world and would love nothing more than to be a part of that after my time in college comes 
          to an end. However, as I am also a math major, I enjoy various types of algorithm design and the theory that 
          comes with it.
